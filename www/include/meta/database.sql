UPDATE news SET content='<p>
	PHP MIDI Parser 1.0 has been released, along with the site 
	dedicated to it. It&#039;s obviously total overkill, but I had 
	fun making it.
</p>
<p>
	Check out the <a href="/demo">demo</a> page to get a feel 
	for what this library can do. The <a href="/docs/">API 
	documentation</a> is also available to help with using the 
	library.
</p>
<p>
	The PHP MIDI Parser library is basically set of well-defined 
	APIs for parsing a MIDI file. It also comes with a set of
	output generators (textual and HTML) that display the results
	of a parse. Every part of the library was built with
	extensibility and customizability in mind, so that others
	could easily adapt it to their needs.
</p>
<p>
	Viewing the <a href="/docs/">documentation</a> will help
	developers get started in using the APIs, and how everything
	is wired together.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks for coming, and <a href="/contact">drop me a
	line</a> to report bugs or if you have any questions.
