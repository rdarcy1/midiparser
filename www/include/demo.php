						Ever wanted to see what Alice in Chains&#039; <em>And We Die Young</em>
						looks like internally? The answer invariably is <strong>OH GOD YES</strong>. 
						This report was generated using the <code>MultiFilePrinter</code> and the
						<code>HtmlFormatter</code>.

					<p>
						<strong>Note</strong>: the HTML that is generated uses
						<a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/attribute-selectors/">CSS3 selectors</a>, 
						which means you need a browser capable of handling that to effectively view
						the results. Firefox 3.5+, Opera 9.5+ and Google Chrome will all suffice. IE
						and other browsers will render correctly, but they won&#039;t be as pretty.
